Unfortunately, these tables were slightly difficult to organize due to the fact that the date could only be organized by counties or districts, not MSAs. To get around this, we downloaded the csv files and consolidated them below so that we had 1 datapoint for each category in each MSA.\n",

    "In our final dataset (msazhvi), the rows represent 52 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) throughout different geographical regions of the US. The columns are different attributes of each MSA, including average home value (2018 ZHVI), highest education attained, income, property taxes, and rent as a percent of income. This dataset was created to interpret our data easier. We had many different observations and calculations that culminated into our final data frame. All data was free and we required no funding, but it came from places like the census and .gov sources. The processes where we ignored data came from looking at the country geographically and choosing cities from diversified areas. We recorded data that we felt could have an impact on housing prices, and other metrics that may be reflective of wealthy areas. We preprocessed some data in excel to make it easier to be called on later for each city. The census did not allow multiple variables at once, so every city had 5 different downloads alone to create two .csv files for the city. People were involved and they were aware, since they had filled out the census. Our data sources are linked in the data collection section"
