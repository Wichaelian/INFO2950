    "Analysis Number 1: Multivariable linear regression predicting housing prices based on all factors. Similar to HW 6, we will try to combine education level, mean income, mean property tax, mean rent as percent of income, temperature, and crime to determine if we are able to get an accurate model to predict housing prices of our Metropolitan Statistical Areas. We will then compare our prediction to the actual prices. We will display the coefficients of each predictor and the R^2 for the entire set. From this data, we will select the variables that are the most valid predictors and graph a 3D scatterplot showing our predictions."
