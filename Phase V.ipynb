    "We began this project by first thinking about what sorts of factors can affect housing prices within the United States. A common life goal for many individuals and families within the United States is buying a home. However, hosuing prices can vary greatly according to different factors like geography, climate, etc. We wanted to see what sorts of factors have the biggest effects on typical housing prices. Having such information can be useful for a variety of reasons. People looking to buy a home could have a better idea as to where to look in order to find cheaper houses. Moreover, homeowners looking to sell could have a better idea as to how local housing prices are determined and have more information during the appraisal process. All in all, knowing how typical housing prices fluctuate due outside factors besides the houses themselves is useful for those looking to buy and sell homes.\n",
    "\n",
    "After some deliberation, we decided to narrow our focus to housing prices within various cities, and chose potential factors based on what we each thought might affect housing prices. We came up with two distinct research questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What factors (including education, taxes, weather, etc.) have the highest correlation with typical housing prices in cities in the USA?\n",
    "- Can such factors be used to accurately predict housing prices within the USA?\n",
    "\n",
    "We gathered housing price data from Zillow, education and economic data from the Census, weather data from the National Weather Service and crime data from the FBI website. We performed multivariate and univariate linear regressions to see if the factors listed can be used to predict typical housing prices. We gathered our most promising results and performed significance tests on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "After performing all our analyses, we did not find particularly high r^2 values for any of our suggested factors, although some of the factors landed within the .4 to .6 range, which demonstrate some correlation. We suspected this was due to the high variability of housing prices within various cities, as well as the variation of housing prices from city to city. We also have no reference point for a \"significant\" correlation for real estate data. However, our significance testing seems to indicate that our results were not random, so we can gather that predictions can be made utilzing our chosen factors with at least some accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the best predictors for housing prices that we discovered seem to be the percentage of educated population, mean income, and climate."

    "Because our Data Collection and Cleaning was quite extensive, we placed it in a separate Jupyter file.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our final dataset (msazhvi), the rows represent 52 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) throughout different geographical regions of the US. The columns are different attributes of each MSA, including typical home value (2018 ZHVI), average percent of highest education attained, average income, average property taxes, average rent as a percent of income, average high temperature of the year, average low temperature of the year, average mean temperature of the year, and various forms of crime per 100k individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The home value data in the 2018 ZHVI is sourced from Zillow and their public data. Zillow has their proprietary home value estimates called 'Zestimates' sourced from a variety of metrics. These metrics come from third party sources, some which are not disclosed due to zestimates being Zillow's special metric. However, other sources are known, such as data.gov, Google Places, and Multiple Listing Service (MLS) data. MLS data is used by real estate brokers to make transactions more efficient, therefore, this data provides Zillow with pricing info. Zillow receives MLS data directly in a data feed when brokers opt into have their listing syndicated by Zillow. Because of their sources and direct connections to real-time transactions, Zillow is able to get provide accurate aggregated estimates for MSAs and their housing prices. \n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the other data comes directly from the census, including average percent of highest education attained, average income, average property taxes, average rent as a percent. Specifically, this data comes from the American Community Survey Data from the census, which is collected every year rather than every 10 years to provide 5-year estimates regarding community metrics. This data is sent out to select members of communities on a rotating basis to guage a sample size to help estimate the metrics. \n",
    "\n",
    "The crime data comes from the FBI and is sorted by all MSAs throughout the country. The data is posted every year, however not every MSA is available each year. The data provides metrics on violent crimes and thievery. Because the FBI is federal, they do not collect the data themselves. Law enforcement agencies around the country provide the data to the FBI yearly, at which point they compile and publish the Uniform Crime Report. \n",
    "\n",
    "The temperature data comes from NOAA and was taken only from the major city in each MSA. This is because the data is not published by MSA but still provides the most accurate estimate since the city is typically located in the geographical center of the MSA. NOAA collects their real-time data from satelites, bouys, weather stations, scientists, and local stations. An interactive map of the US allows the user to click on a geographical region and then a city within. Data from each city had to be collected individually and compiled into a csv by hand, as there was no way to download all available data. \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset was created in order to more effectively compare various factors and their effects on typical home values within cities. We decided to focus on an entire year (2018), so we had to consolidate the ZHVI data, which was calculated monthly. We also focused on Metropolitan Statistical Areas surrounding cities, so we also consolidated the Census data by performing weighted averages of the county variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the data we collected was free and we required no funding. There are links in the Data Collection section to the specific sources where we gathered our data from. \n",
    "\n",
    "We chose factors somewhat arbitrarily; we chose them based on what we suspected would have an effect on typical house price.\n"

    "#### Multivariate Linear Regression\n",
    "The MLR slopes from above can be interpreted as follows:\n",
    "- Every time the average percentage of the population that is at least high school educated goes up by 1 percentage point, the typical house price for that city goes up by around 3000 dollars.\n",
    "- Every time the mean income for a city goes up by 1 dollar, the typical house price increases by 5 dollars. \n",
    "- Every time the average property tax for a city increases by a dollar, the typical house price decreases by 26 dollars.\n",
    "- Finally, every time the average percent of income spent on rent increases by 1 percentage point, the typical house price for that city goes up by 227 dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "The r^2 value from the MLR is .65, which may not seem particularly high, but it implies that there is at least some number of housing prices that can be predicted with these factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, there seems to be a relatively large positive correlation between the amount of high-school educated individuals in a city and the typical house price. However, this does not necessarily point to a causative relationship. While a better education may lead to a higher income, there is also a chance that wealthier individuals (who can afford more expensive homes), are more likely to pursue or have their children pursue a better education.\n",
    "\n",
    "The positive correlation between income and housing price, albeit small, can be explained by the idea that individuals with higher paying jobs have more disposable income. In response, housing prices could potentially increase to \"keep up\" with higher incomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are unsure as to why there is a negative relationship between property taxes and housing prices when performing MLR.\n",
    "\n",
    "The positive correlation between percent of income spent on rent and housing price seems relatively self-evident. The more expensive it is to rent a house, the more expensive it should be to own a house. This does not necessarily imply causation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Univariate Linear Regressions\n",
    "\n",
    "For the education linear regression, there seems to be a slightly positive slope with a r^2 value of .27. This doesn't seem extremely statistically significant. It seems that education has a higher correlation with housing prices when taking other factors into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the mean income linear regression, there seems to be a slightly positive slope with a r^2 value of .57. This is somewhat higher than the other linear regressions, which seems to imply that some housing prices can be predicted utilizing mean income.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the linear regressions of property tax and percentage of income spent on rent, there are slightly positive slopes and low r^2 values. They don't seem statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Crime Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the Multivariate and Univariate Linear Regessions had relatively low r^2 values, so crime doesn't seem to be an effective predictor of housing prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Climate Data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multivariate Linear Regression\n",
    "The MLR slopes can be interpreted as follows:\n",
    "- Every time the average high temperature increases by 1 degree Fahrenheit, the housing price increases by around 3000 dollars.\n",
    "- Every time the average low temperature increases by 1 degree Fahrenheit, the housing price increases by around 16000 dollars.\n",
    "- Every time the average annual temperature increases by 1 degree Fahrenheit, the housing price decreases by around 26000 dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "The r^2 value from the MLR is .59, which may not seem particularly high, but it implies that there is at least some number of housing prices that can be predicted by temperature. \n",
    "\n",
    "It seems that the average overall temperature has the largest slope with housing prices. If housing prices are used to determine desirability of living within a location, perhaps higher overall temperatures are less desirable, and lead to a lower price. In addition, average low temperatures also have a relatively high slope. Perhaps people care more about avoiding the cold rather than seeking out the heat. This would mean that locations with milder weather are more desirable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The univariate linear regressions did not have particularly high r^2 values, so they don't seem to be statistically significant. However, when calculating average temperature range by subtracting the mean high and mean low temperatures, there is a negative relationship with housing prices and a low r^2 value. This could potentially indicate that less variable weather is more desirable, which leads to higher house prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Word About Outliers...\n",
    "So far, we have only discussed the r^2 values from the function that includes outliers (performRsquared()). Taking a look at the r^2 values calculated by the function that does not include outliers (performRsquaredNoOutliers()) we can observe in some cases, signifigant differences from the outlier-included r^2 values, and in most cases, this was a decrease. Specifically, we observed decreases in the r^2 of almost all of our variables except those in the crime category. It should be noted that in most cases, outliers were removed by performRsquaredNoOutliers() due to having a very high ZHVI. What this suggests is that our observed correlations are still applicable to MSAs with high ZHVIs rather than just strictly applying to the main \"pack\".  "
